//! Freshness substrate for the cached graph projection (mnestic fork;
//! `docs/specs/graph-projection.md` §3.3–3.4).
//!
//! A projection is a named, in-memory CSR adjacency built from stored
//! relations and reused across `FixedRule` calls. The signed guarantee is
//! **always-fresh**: a projection never serves data that differs from what the
//! consuming transaction's own scan of the sources would return, in *either*
//! direction — no stale entries to fresh snapshots, and no fresh entries to
//! stale snapshots. Under write churn it degrades to build-per-query, never
//! worse than today.
//!
//! # The watermark protocol
//!
//! State: a process-global monotone [`ProjectionCache::bump_seq`], and a
//! per-relation [`RelState`] holding the token of that relation's last
//! observed mutation plus a count of commits currently in flight against it.
//! An absent map entry reads as `{token: 0, inflight: 0}` — "never mutated in
//! this process" — which is sound because a relation's state, once written,
//! is **never removed**: a destroyed relation keeps its entry as a permanent
//! tombstone. Destruction does not make an id unresolvable — a transaction
//! whose snapshot predates the destroy still resolves it through its own
//! catalog view — and the tombstone's bumped token is the only thing denying
//! such transactions a cache exchange (Phase 3/4 adversarial review,
//! 2026-07-10; an earlier purge-on-destroy made absence ambiguous and opened
//! a stale-hit window). Ids are never reused within a process
//! (`relation_store_id` is monotone), so a tombstone cannot shadow a live
//! relation.
//!
//! Every [`SessionTx`](crate::runtime::transact::SessionTx) captures
//! `watermark = bump_seq.load()` **strictly before** the storage transaction
//! opens, because opening *is* pinning: the snapshot is a side effect of the
//! constructor. A bump landing between the load and the pin only pushes that
//! relation's token above the watermark, i.e. a conservative miss.
//!
//! Writers, per the dirty set collected during the transaction:
//! [`begin_commit`](ProjectionCache::begin_commit) raises `inflight` before
//! the storage commit; [`finish_commit`](ProjectionCache::finish_commit)
//! assigns a fresh token and lowers `inflight` after it returns — **on failure
//! as well as success**, because `mem`'s `del_range_from_persisted` mutates the
//! persisted store outside the transaction cache, so a failed destructive
//! transaction may still have changed state. A transaction dropped without
//! committing takes [`bump_aborted`](ProjectionCache::bump_aborted) for the
//! same reason.
//!
//! The freshness predicate, evaluated under the map mutex, is
//!
//! ```text
//! FRESH(T, R)  ≜  inflight(R) == 0  ∧  token(R) <= T.watermark
//! ```
//!
//! Both consuming a cached entry and inserting one require `FRESH` on every
//! source relation. **Claim**: `FRESH(T, R)` implies R's content in T's
//! snapshot equals R's content committed as of the moment of evaluation. Let W
//! be any committed write to R.
//!
//! * *W committed before T's pin* (so W **is** in T's snapshot): either W's
//!   bump completed before T's watermark load — then `token(R) <= watermark`
//!   and W is counted on both sides — or it had not, in which case at
//!   evaluation time the bump has since run (`token(R) > watermark`: a
//!   `fetch_add` sequenced after the load returns a strictly larger value) or
//!   it still has not (`inflight >= 1`). Either way `FRESH` fails.
//! * *W committed after T's pin* (so W is **not** in T's snapshot): its bump
//!   follows its commit, which follows the pin, which follows the load, so
//!   `token(R) > watermark` once bumped and `inflight >= 1` until then.
//!   `FRESH` fails.
//!
//! So under `FRESH` the snapshot holds exactly the committed state. Insertion
//! tags an entry with tokens denoting exactly that content version; a consumer
//! demands the same tokens *and* `FRESH` for itself, so entry content =
//! current content = consumer-snapshot content. Both staleness directions are
//! closed. Every race degrades to a spurious miss, and aborts, failures and
//! drops only add more of them.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! This module is **not** behind `graph-algo`. The dirty-set hooks live in
//! thirteen mutation paths across `query/stored.rs`, `runtime/relation.rs` and
//! `runtime/db.rs`; conditionally compiling them is where a silently missed
//! hook — the one failure mode this protocol exists to prevent — would hide.
//! The cost of maintaining the substrate with no projections in existence is
//! one atomic load per transaction, one `BTreeSet` insert per mutation
//! *statement* (not per row), and one uncontended mutex acquisition per
//! *writing* commit. The cached entries themselves, which own the
//! `graph`-crate CSR types, arrive in Phase 2 behind `graph-algo`.
